### Change Classification Machine Learning Model - Lesson 1 - Creating and training the Model

The chosen dataset is from the Change Request system of a ficticious Cloud company containing all their change data from the previous year. Using this data we will attempt to train and test a Machine Learning Model using various Classification Algorithms that can be used via a prediction API to later assign live data to various technical teams. The dataset we have is limited as we only have the Change ID, Requestor, Client, Location, and Classification of each change. We will aim to get an above 80% accuracy rate with our Machine Learning Model.

Note: All names in this data are ficticious and were generated using the name generator at https://www.name-generator.org.uk/
